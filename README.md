ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @GeorgyBerezhnoy
My primary research interest has been in the area of analytic techniques of NMR spectroscopy 
and other methods for chemical and biochemical research.

With the rising importance of probing molecular changes by NMR data analysis software, 
I have found a need for reaching new levels of operating in the work with various metabolic systems.

A project on which I am currently focused on has a goal of sorting out the most distinctive metabolites 
from NMR fingerprinting spectra and MS profile analysis, to report about newly discovered disease biomarkers of human metabolome.
